# MulapiziðŸ’»

## Intoduction

This project aims at solving the problem of Laptop theft in Universities. The software built on C is a command-line tool for Registering new laptops & students and ensuring that there is no mismatch in the Laptop ownership. The name `Mulapizi` stems from three words `mulika`, `laptop` and `wizi` all truncated at different points to make a creative feel of the software.
